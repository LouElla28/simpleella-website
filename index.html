 <p> Hi my name is Marcellana, Erica, 23years old,living at fairview, Quezon city. I have child and husband, Currently. I am Studiying as a Senior High School Student at AKCS. and this is my Unforgettable Experience As a Student</p>

 <p>What I Never Forget as a student is when we had a fieldtrip during my junior high school years (grade 8)</p>

     <p>ps. they didn't give me a belt, even though they said they will give me one, I already finish my first sem but still haven't received any belt. haha.</p>
     <h4>LESSON LEARN</h4>
     <p>before the nightfall, start orginizing your school uniform so they won't look messy when you wear your uniform haha.</p>

     <p>But even so, despite that, my Experience as a student of bestlink is the best. Even thougt I didn't finish my SHS there, many good things happend. I meet new friends who are still my friend no, and they became a godparents of my son. I also Experience stargazing, and the best part is their Foundation day where many artist attend.</p>
